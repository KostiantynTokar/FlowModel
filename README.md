# FlowModel
Modelling of a 2D flow that faces an obstacle.

To build Flow.exe, one should add [Boost](https://www.boost.org/),
[Eigen](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page), and
[tqdm](https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm.cpp) to the project.

Python script for building resulting gif's requires [NumPy](https://pypi.org/project/numpy/),
[Matplotlib](https://pypi.org/project/matplotlib/), and
[tqdm](https://pypi.org/project/tqdm/).
